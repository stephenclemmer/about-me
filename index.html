        <h3>Career Experience</h3>
        <p>Within the last decade I have lived in New York City, Chicago, and Seattle. In New York I worked as a recording engineer where I was fortunate enough to work on projects with great artists including Norah Jones and The Rolling Stones.</p>
        <p>In 2013 I moved to Chicago to help launch a green pest control brand. That experience allowed me to help every Chicagoan live and work in greener, safer buildings.</p>
        <p>In 2021 I moved to Seattle where I caught the coding bug. I attended Code Fellows to hone those skills and become a software developer</p>

        <h3>Goals</h3> 
        <p>I recently moved to Seattle, so my short-term goals include making new friends and networking with other professionals in the tech industry, and securing a role as a software developer.</p>
        
        <p>My long-term goals include landing a software development role where I can work remotely so that I, and my girlfriend who is also a software developer, can travel the World while we work, strengthening my legs, core, and shoulders, recording an album of my original songs, and mastering the jumprope.</p>
