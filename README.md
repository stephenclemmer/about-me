## 201 Lab 2, 3, &4

- As a TA, I created a 'lab3' branch to preserve the site before attempting the stretch goals for lab 4
- I created a 'lab4' branch (which should be the same content as the branch 'lab3, but which can be used to style the page')
- I created a ''stretchGoals' branch which will be used to complete the stretch goals in lab 4.

2. Reset needs to come before the stylesheet in the HTML document.
